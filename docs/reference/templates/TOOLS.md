# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Workspace Capabilities

Quick reference for what you can do with your workspace:

| Action                  | How                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read/write config files | `agents.files.get` / `agents.files.set` (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.)  |
| Upload files            | `agents.files.set` with `name: "uploads/filename.ext"`                           |
| Set avatar              | `agents.files.set` with `name: "avatars/image.png"` + `encoding: "base64"`       |
| List files              | `agents.files.list` — shows config files, uploads, and avatars                   |
| Delete files            | `agents.files.delete` with the file name                                         |
| Binary files            | Add `encoding: "base64"` to `agents.files.set` — text files are UTF-8 by default |

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
